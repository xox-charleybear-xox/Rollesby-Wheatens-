            <h1>About the Breed</h1>
            <h3></h3>
            <p> “A Wheaten.” “From the land of mysterious druids, wailing banshees & impish leprechauns comes this
                bundle of
                joy”. <br> He has a typical happy-go-lucky Irish outlook. He loves children and thrives on human
                companionship. <br> Extrovert and exuberant, he is willing to go anywhere at any time. He requires a
                little
                patience to train, but is eager to please."
            </p>
            <p>His coat, when natural, needs very little care: described as the colour of ripening wheat, it is soft and
                silky and suits his jaunty approach to life. <br> A sturdy dog who is hardy and unexaggerated in any
                way, he
                makes an excellent house pet.</p>
            <p> Wheatens are a medium sized compact upstanding terrier well covered with a soft, wheaten coloured
                natural
                coat that falls in loose curls or waves. <br> An active short coupled dog, strong and well built, well
                balanced
                in structure and movement, not exaggerated in any way. <br> Standing four square with head and tail up,
                giving
                the appearance of a happy dog full of character.
            </p>

            <p>The Wheaten is of such an intelligence that he often knows his owners moods and wishes before they
                do.<br>
                They are a constant companion and will willingly follow you to the end and back. They are trusting and
                full
                of compassion and very devoted. <br> Wheatens suit all manner of lifestyles from a small flat to
                wide-open
                spaces. They are great with children and other pets Very inquisitive and fun loving.</p>
