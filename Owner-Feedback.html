            <p> We have bought 2 of Shelley‚Äôs beautiful puppies. <br> From the initial enquires Shelley kept
                us up to date
                sending photos of the pups & how they were progressing.<br> She organised their flights up to AKL & each
                had
                a
                toy that one of my dogs still has today 9 years later. <br> Both my dogs have lovely natures & very
                loving
                they
                are absolutely part of our family. <br> They are the best breed & Shelley is the best breeder, she has
                kept
                in
                touch with us over the years always available offering advice if required. <br> (Clooney as a puppy then

            <h3>W&N Cochrane </h3>
            <p>
                2 kids.
                9 years ago our daughter (15) was in constant agony from a virus that attack her nerve ends, even on
                very strong pain relief which did nothing for her.<br> One specialist suggested getting her a pet?
                The girls came up with Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier would be the dog breed then found ROLLESBY
                WHEATENS.<br> After some research and contact was made.
                I wasn‚Äôt so keen as I still had a farm to run in South Canterbury but I knew it would give my daughter
                some relief so I said yes as long as I don‚Äôt get anymore work. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§™ü§£what joke.<br> Monty was a
                little
                brother to our daughter but he seem to know I was his master and follow my most of the time like a
                shadow and suckered me into anything. <br>But I‚Äôll never forget hearing my daughter laughing for the
                first
                time in a long time as she went running around our house with Monty trying to catch her slipping and
                sliding everywhere. It was totally hilarious and the relief that everyone needed.<br>Unfortunately our
                brand-new rimu timber floor didn‚Äôt look new for long as Monty‚Äôs nails got bigger.
                Monty was easy to train is very intelligent & cute and he knows it too üôÑ loves coming with me on
                landscape photography & loves hiking. Loves being in the vehicles or boat. He didn‚Äôt like the farm much
                until he was about 3.5 then I sold it. <br> But he‚Äôs happy to bark at cattle and sheep in your ear in
                the car
                ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
                He turns 9 soon and is totally a joy to be around and is part of our family. Best thing I have brought
                in 9 years hands down. <br>
                He is a very happy relaxed dog and well used to all the hugs and pats & being photographed by strangers
                on top of what he gets from us. He makes so many people smile. <br>
                He gets recognised a lot as I post regularly on IG & FB as #montymonday to keep his fans happy all
                around the planet.
                We are responsible for a few people getting a Wheaton.<br>
                No regrets. <br> Very happy to recommend Shelley and her Wheatens <br>
