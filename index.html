            <h1>Welcome to the home of Rollesby Wheatens</h1>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>Breeders of quality purebred Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers. <br> Max came into our lives in 1999 and
                things
                were never to be the same again. <br> Sophie soon joined Max, then Izzy, Mac, Tillee, Fynn, Poppee,
                Skyie,
                Shannon & Maggie....for now...!!!
            <p>


            <p>Our breeding program boasts lines from the acclaimed Stevelyn & Kariskiye Kennels in the UK. <br> Fynn is
                our
                new English import and is sired by the Top winning wheaten " Fantasy Blonde Kaos" in the Uk in 2009,
                2010,
                2011 so you can be assured that our dogs come from a well established line of quality wheatens.</p>
            <p>Our dogs come from a family home environment they live with a multitude of other farm pets/animals. <br>
                They own half of the house and would not dream of spending a minute more than they have to outside if not with us. <br> They are super loyal,
                trustworthy
                with all small creatures i.e. baby kune kune piglets, chicks, chickens and rabbits etc <br> they also
                get on
                with all their larger friends like the Clydesdales. <br> They are super adaptable and can live wherever you
                are, whether it be a tent, holiday home or just hanging at home. <br> One of their main criteria is that the are with you!!</p>

            <p>Our wheaten pups from the first day they are born are thrust into our family life. <br> They are used to
                the other animals and all household sounds, are socialised with our other dogs, children & adults. <br> So by the
                time they reach you not a lot phases them.
            </p>
